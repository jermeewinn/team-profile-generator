# team-profile-generator

## Description:

This project demonstrates how Node Package Manager (npm) can help in making coding more efficient through Test-Driven Development (TDD Method). 

Here we'll be using the TDD method to test multiple actors (Employee, Manager, Engineer, & Intern), and use the code to help us create a team profile generator.
Alongside TDD, we'll also be using Inquirer and FS to create a question prompt for the user to fill out, and use the results to generate a simple HTML page.

## Installation:
- $git clone git@github.com:jermeewinn/team-profile-generator.git
- $npm init
- $npm install inquirer
- $npm install jest --save-dev

## Languages used:

* HTML (generated)
* CSS Bulma
